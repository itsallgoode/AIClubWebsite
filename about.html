                    <p>Hi everyone. My name is Branden Chen, and currently I am a senior at KSU, pursuing a major in CS and a minor in Math. My hobbies include playing badminton, video games, and learning more about data science and ml. Currently, I am doing research involving pretraining medical segmentation models and multi-party encryption on activation functions such as ReLU. I hope to see everyone in our meetings!.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Charles and I'm a second year mathematics major. I tutor math at KSU's SMART Center and conduct research in the machine learning field. I'm very interested in the application of machine learning in finance, and spend most of my freetime either learning, lifting weights, or cooking. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can accomplish this semester!</p>

                    <p>Hey Everyone! My name is Sanjay and I am a second year CS major! I am involved in AI/ML research specifically with adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms and also with image classification/detection. Outside of class I love editing in my free time, watching anime, and doom scrolling on TikTok. A fun fact about me is that I used to move states so much I had to continue studying 4th grade in 3 different schools! I'm so excited to be your treasurer for this semester!</p>

                    <p>Hello! I'm pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at KSU with an Artificial Intelligence concentration. I'm interested in all facets of AI, but am especially in intersection of AI and philosophy, cybersecurity, and social organization. I also enjoy playing video games, hiking, and powerlifting. I'm thrilled to be your media manager for this semester, and I can't wait to meet you!
