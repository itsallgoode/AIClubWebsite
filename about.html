                    <p>Hey Everyone! My name is Sanjay and I am a second year CS major! I am involved in AI/ML research specifically with adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms and also with image classification/detection. Outside of class I love editing in my free time, watching anime, and doom scrolling on TikTok. A fun fact about me is that I used to move states so much I had to continue studying 4th grade in 3 different schools! I'm so excited to be your treasurer for this semester!</p>

                    <p><strong>Media Manager</strong></p>
                    <p>Hello! I'm pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at KSU with an Artificial Intelligence concentration. I'm interested in all facets of AI, but am especially in intersection of AI and philosophy, cybersecurity, and social organization. I also enjoy playing video games, hiking, and powerlifting.

                        I'm thrilled to be your media manager for this semester, and I can't wait to meet you!
                        </p>
